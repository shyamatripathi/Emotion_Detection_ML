# Emotion_Detection_ML
Emotion Recognition in Conversations
This project is created using pre-trained models and existing datasets to detect emotions in text or speech. 
This ML models can classify text into eight basic emotions, including anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.
Tools used: Following tools are used in making this project--

1)Pandas:- Used for loading and manipulating data. This library makes it easy to load datasets from files like CSVs, perform data transformations, and manage DataFrames.



2)Scikit-learn (sklearn):-
train_test_split: Splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, helping to create separate datasets for model training and evaluation.
TfidfVectorizer: Converts the text data into a numeric format using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), a common feature extraction technique for natural language processing tasks.
LogisticRegression: A machine learning model for binary and multiclass classification tasks.
Metrics (accuracy_score and classification_report): Used to evaluate the model's performance on validation and test datasets by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
